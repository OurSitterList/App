          <h3 class="title-6"><span>Hi! Welcome to Our Sitter List Nashville. We are so excited you are here.</span></h3>
          <p>Babysitting  is a great way to make a little extra money, but sometimes it's hard to find  families to babysit for, the work is sporadic, or long-standing, reliable work  comes to a quick close when families move or their needs change.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Our  Sitter List Nashville is here to make the work of finding consistent jobs  easier by connecting great sitters with caring, reputable families they know  they can trust.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Our  Sitter List Nashville personally interviews each parent candidate. We also  guarantee that if there is any parent member we don&rsquo;t know, we will ask for  references.</p>
          <p><strong>We also pre-negotiate the babysitting hourly rate for you.*</strong></p>
          <h3 class="title-6"><span>Babysitting Rates</span></h3>
          <ul class="list-1">
            <li>1  child @ $11/hour </li>
            <li>2  children @ $12/hour</li>
            <li>3  children @ $14/hour</li>
            <li>4  children @ $15/hour</li>
            <li>More  than 4 children will be an additional $1/hour per child </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="sm-text"><em>*If you desire a  higher rate, please discuss with the founders. We are open to discussion.</em></p>
          <h3 class="title-6"><span>How Much Does it Cost?</span></h3>
          <p><em>Sitters pay a one-time application fee of $25. </em></p>
          <p><em>You then will need to have the following check out  in order for us to approve you to our site:</em></p>
          <ul class="list-1">
            <li><em>Pass background check**</em></li>
            <li><em>Fill out application which  includes 2 references</em></li>
            <li><em>Meet one or both of the founders</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Why do we charge you to join our site? We are different  that other sites because we check your references, interview you and perform a  background check on the front end. By doing that, we make it easier for you to  find sitting jobs, because parents know they can trust our process. The $25 you  pay here is an investment that will bring great returns in consistent  babysitting jobs.</p>
          <p><em>**The only exception is  those babysitters still in high school.</em></p>
