                    <p>Sitter Members and Parent Members transact solely between themselves.  Our Sitter List Nashville is not a party to any transactions between Authorized Users.  Our Sitter List Nashville hereby expressly disclaims, and you hereby expressly release Our Sitter List Nashville from, any and all liability whatsoever for any controversies, claims, suits, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to disputes, dealings, or interactions between you and any other Authorized User of this internet website or third parties.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="title-6"><span>Accounts with Our Sitter List Nashville </span></h3>
                    <p>You’ll need to create an account with Our Sitter List Nashville.  Here are a few rules about accounts.</p>
                    <h5 class="sub-heading">User Information:</h5>
                    <p>Authorized Users will be required to provide Our Sitter List Nashville with certain information including a person’s valid e-mail address.  Our Sitter List Nashville will not disclose to any third party the name, address, e-mail address or telephone number of any Authorized User without such Authorized User’s prior consent, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or pursuant to a Court Order.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="sub-heading">User Submissions:</h5>
                    <p>Each Authorized User is responsible for his or her own communications and the consequences of his or her own communications.  Authorized Users may not, and agree that they shall not post material that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or on the privacy or publicity rights of others; post material that is obscene, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another user or any other person or entity; post a sexually-explicit image or statement; post advertisements or solicitations of business, post chain letters or pyramid schemes; impersonate another person; or post material that contains viruses or other computer programming engines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="sub-heading">The Basics:</h5>
                    <p>Sitter Members must be 18 or older to use our Services.  Otherwise, you may only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
                    <p>Authorized Users must be honest with us.  Provide accurate information about yourself.  It’s not okay to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.</p>
                    <p>Choose a nice username.  A username that is offensive, vulgar, or infringes someone’s intellectual property rights violates the House Rules.</p>
                    <p>You will need a password.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and account information for the Service, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account.  You agree to immediately notify Our Sitter List Nashville of any unauthorized use of accounts or any other breach of security.</p>
                    <p>Third-Party Services.  Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest).  The third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use.  Our Sitter List Nashville is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you and the third party.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="sub-heading">Paid Membership:</h5>
                    <p>Access to certain Our Sitter List Nashville’s services require a paid membership.  Upon registration for a Paid Membership, you agree to pay Our Sitter List Nashville the applicable membership fees at the prices then in effect, and you authorize Our Sitter List Nashville to charge your chosen payment method in connection therewith.  Our Sitter List Nashville reserves the right to correct any payment errors even if it has already requested and/or received payment.</p>
                    <p>Our Sitter List Nashville may use third-party payment processing services to process credit card payments and information in connection with the payment of membership fees and other amounts payable in connection with the Service. </p>
                    <p>Parent Members shall pay their Sitter Members for their employment.

                    <h5 class="sub-heading">Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation:</h5>
                    <p>Our Sitter List Nashville paid membership subscriptions will continue indefinitely until cancelled by the Parent Member.  After your initial subscription commitment period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period as the subscription term you originally selected and at the subscription rate and the frequency disclosed to you on www.oursitterlistnashville.com, unless otherwise provided at the time you subscribed.  If you sign up for a payment plan that allows you to be charged monthly over the subscription period and you decide to cancel your subscription during the subscription period, you acknowledge and agree that you will continue to be billed on a monthly basis until its originally scheduled expiration date. </p>
                    <p>You may cancel your paid membership subscription by contacting Our Sitter List Nashville at oursitterlistnashville@gmail.com.  If you cancel your subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term.  Your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your credit card will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.</p>
