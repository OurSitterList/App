                    <p>Hopefully, your association with <span class="highlight">www.oursitterlistnashville.com</span> will be rewarding and you will never need to use this section.  But, just in case things do not go well from your perspective, please read this carefully.  This is here for you.  It sets out certain substantive and procedural rules.</p>
                    <p>First, if you are upset with another user of www.oursitterlistnashville.com or a third party, we respectfully direct you to contact that person or entity and try to work out the dispute.  In fact, you shall release <span class="highlight">www.oursitterlistnashville.com</span> from any claims, demands and damages arising out of disputes with other users or third parties. </p>
                    <p>Second, if you are upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue.  Open communication is the first step in resolution.  If a dialogue does not work out, you shall give <span class="highlight">www.oursitterlistnashville.com</span> a written Notice of Dispute identifying the nature of the grievance and the corrective action necessary to remedy the dispute.  The Notice of Dispute shall be sent to: <span class="highlight">oursitterlistnashville@gmail.com</span>.</p>
                    <p>If the dispute cannot be resolved, then the parties agree that the dispute shall be submitted to Arbitration.

Any award rendered by the arbitrator is binding except under very restricted conditions mandating modification, correction or vacation of an award by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Your applying for membership to <span class="highlight">www.oursitterlistnashville.com</span>  constitutes your consent to Arbitration. </p>

                    <p>We hope this never happens, but if Our Sitter List Nashville gets sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us.  That means you’ll defend Our Sitters List Nashville (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, or your breach of the House Rules. </p>
                    
                	<h3 class="title-6"><span>Lastly:  Severability</span></h3>
                    <p>If any part of this contract is found unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the rest of the contract shall remain enforceable.  This contract does not serve to give you legal advice.  We tried to let you know about the House Rules and this contract was not meant to give you legal advice.  You are encouraged to seek your own counsel, if you have any questions about the House Rules.  Lastly, y’all, the laws of Tennessee shall govern the rights and liabilities of <span class="highlight">www.oursitterlistnashville.com</span>, its users and third parties.</p>
