                        <p> Our Sitter List Nashville was formed in 2015 by Whitney  Schickling and Karly Hart, two working moms of four active children under the  age of seven. Also sisters-in-law and best friends, Whitney and Karly found  themselves constantly struggling to find trustworthy babysitters while juggling  busy work and social schedules. Many of their Nashville friends shared the same  frustration. Fueled by the desire to make it easier for great families to find  great childcare, along with their entrepreneurial spirits and trust in each  other, they launched Our Sitter List LLC, the parent of <a href="#">www.oursitterlistnashville.com.</a>&nbsp;</p>
