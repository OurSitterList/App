<p>Last updated: March 19, 2019</p>


<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Our Sitter List mobile application (the "Service") operated by Our Sitter List, LLC ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>


<h2>Communications</h2>

<p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>


<h2>Purchases</h2>

<p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>

<p>The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>


<h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>

<p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.</p>

<p>We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>




<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Our Sitter List, LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Our Sitter List, LLC customer support team.</p>

<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Our Sitter List, LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Our Sitter List, LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Our Sitter List, LLC will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>




<h2>Fee Changes</h2>

<p>Our Sitter List, LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

<p>Our Sitter List, LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
