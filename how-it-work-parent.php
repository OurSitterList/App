          <h3 class="title-6"><span>Hi! Welcome to Our Sitter List Nashville. We are so excited you are here.</span></h3>

          <p>Ideally, we would all  find our babysitters by word of mouth, from friends we rely on or family  members who know us and our children well. But all too often, friends only have  a couple of go-to sitters, and we're hesitant to ask for their names. Or, once  we've found a reliable childcare provider, we dread the day when she graduates  from college or &quot;outgrows&quot; babysitting, knowing that will mean  another exhaustive search for someone new.&nbsp;</p>

          <p> But what if you had  access to a sitter list filled with pre-screened candidates, who you could  hand-pick based on the profiles provided, after reading reviews from families  they've worked with?&nbsp;</p>

          <p> <a class="highlight" href="/about_us.php">Whitney Schickling  and Karly Hart</a>, founders of Our Sitter List  Nashville, thought that would be just dreamy, so they decided to take matters  in their own hands and make it happen. &nbsp;</p>

          <p> Our  Sitter List Nashville is the only babysitting resource in Nashville that  personally interviews each sitter candidate. We also guarantee that each sitter  has been background* checked and reference checked. Additionally, we encourage  all of our babysitters to become&nbsp;<em>CPR and First Aid Certified</em>.</p>

          <p><em>*  Babysitters still in high school have not been background checked.</em></p>

          <h3 class="title-6"><span>We do all the homework for you.</span></h3>

          <p>We ask all of our babysitters to the highlight the following on their profile:</p>

          <ul class="list-1">

            <li>Experience with child food allergies</li>

            <li>Willing to do overnight babysitting</li>

            <li>Willing to travel with families</li>

            <li>Available for semi-permanent/permanent placement</li>

            <li>Newborn experience</li>

            <li>CPR certified</li>

            <li>First Aid Certified</li>

            <li>Infant Newborn CPR Certified</li>

            <li>Willing to care for sick kids (i.e. common cold, stomach bug, etcâ€¦</li>

          </ul>

          <p>If a babysitter cancels last minute, then she must notify us  immediately and we will find a replacement sitter for you.</p>

          <p><strong>Still  have questions?</strong>&nbsp;Check out the babysitter&rsquo;s individual profile where you  can read feedback from Nashville families, some of whom you may know!&nbsp;</p>
